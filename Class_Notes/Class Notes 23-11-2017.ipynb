    "\n",
    "** Q: I downloaded a module, why do i also have to import it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: In order to import and use a module, you need to first have it installed. After you install it, your Python program can \"activate\" it by importing it into memory. Real-life analogy: You can think of \"download\" as notes that you have written down over time, and of \"import\" as you reading and remembering some of them. Your memory, like the computer memory, is limited and you can only keep a small amount of things loaded/imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Q: And, how many times do i have to import a module?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Basically, once per Python Notebook, before you use it for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Q: Can we use the CSV module in the assignment?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Q: How to distinguish a file between TSV, CSV, and TXT formats? **\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The distinction between CSV and TSV (and also a simple textual TXT file) is a matter of an agreement on how to structure your text. So you can also see TSV and CSV as a specific cases of textual file, where people have agreed to structure the text in a tabular format. Because of this, we are using the same starting point to *open* TXT, CSV and TSV files, but we make a difference when we want to *read (or write)* their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Q: How should Python know to open as a tsv?  Would it be to add .tsv to the end of the filename? **\n",
    "\n",
    "A: How does Python know if some file is a TSV or CSV or X? There is no bulletproof answer here. In many cases, we can rely on the extension which is often correct (.tsv for TSV files, .csv for CSV files, .txt for unstructured textual files). This is a good practice. \n",
    "But this is not always the case in practice, sometimes people do not use the right extension. A more certain way is to know what kind of data you are dealing with before you write the program. So make sure you print a line or two from a file in order to deduce what format it is in.\n"
