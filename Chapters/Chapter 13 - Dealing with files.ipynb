    "In this chapter you will learn how to read data from files, do some analysis and write the results to disk. Reading and writing files is quite an essential part of programming, as it is the first step for your program to communicate with the outside world. In most cases you will write programs that take data from some source, manipulates it in someway and writes some results out somewhere. For example if you would write a survey, you could take input from participants on a webserver and save their answers in some files or in a database. When the survey is over you would read these results in and do some analysis on the data you have collected, maybe do some visualizations and save your results.\n",

    "* open one or multiple text files;\n",
    "* work with the modules `os` and `glob`\n",
    "* read the contents of a file\n",
    "* write new or manipulated content to new (or existing) files;\n",

    "Let's start with opening a file in Python. To do this, we need to associate the file on disk with a variable in Python. First, we tell Python where the file is stored on your disk. The location of your file is often referred to as the <span style=\"background-color:yellow\">file path</span>. Python will start looking in the 'working' or 'current' directory (which often will be where your Python script is). If it's in the working directory, you only have to tell Python the name of the file (e.g. `charlie.txt`). If it's not in the working directory, as in our case, you have to tell Python the exact path to your file. We will create a string variable to store this information:"

    "Also note that the formatting of file paths is different across operating systems. The file path as specified above should work on any UNIX platform (Linux, Mac). If you are using Windows, however, you might run into problems when formatting file paths in this way **outside of this notebook**, because Windows uses backslashes instead of forward slashes (Jupyter Notebook should already have taken care of these problems for you). In that case, it might be useful to have a look at [this page](http://www.howtogeek.com/137096/6-ways-the-linux-file-system-is-different-from-the-windows-file-system/) about the differences between the file systems, and at [this page](https://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2008/06/04/gotcha-%E2%80%94-backslashes-in-windows-filenames/) about solving this problem in Python.

    "Another module that you will frequently see being used in examples is the `os` module. If you want to quickly find all the pathnames matching a specified pattern, the simple but powerful `glob` module is the way to go. However, the `os` module has many more features that can be very useful and which are not supported by the `glob` module. We will not go over each and every useful method here, but here's a list of some of the things that you can do (some of which we have seen above): \n",
    "- creating single or multiple directories: `os.mkdir()`, `os.mkdirs()`;\n",
    "- removing single or multiple directories: `os.rmdir()`, `os.rmdirs()`;\n",
    "- checking whether something is a file or a directory: `os.path.isfile()`, `os.path.isdir()`;\n",
    "- split a path and return a tuple containing the directory and filename: `os.path.split()`;\n",
    "- construct a pathname out of one or more partial pathnames: `os.path.join()`\n",
    "- split a filename and return a tuple containing the filename and the file extension: `os.path.splitext()`\n",
    "- get only the basename or the directory path: `os.path.basename()`, `os.path.dirname()`."
