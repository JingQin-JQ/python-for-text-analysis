    "We have seen that Python has several built-in functions (e.g. `print()` or `max()`). But you can also create your own function. A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Once you have defined a function, you can use it at any place in your Python script. You can even import a function from an external module (as we will see in the next chapter). Therefore, they are very useful for tasks that you will perform more often. Plus, functions are a convenient way to order your code and make it more readable!\n",
    "\n",
    "### At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "* write your own function\n",
    "* work with function inputs\n",
    "* understand the difference between (keyword and positional) arguments and parameters\n",
    "* return zero, one, or multiple values\n",
    "* write function docstrings\n",
    "* understand scope of variables\n",

    "## 1. Writing a function\n",
    "\n",
    "A <span style=\"background-color:yellow\">function</span> is an isolated chunk of code, that has a name, gets zero or more parameters, and returns a value. In general, a function will do something for you, based on a number of input parameters you pass it, and it will typically return a result. You are not limited to using functions available from in the standard library or the ones provided by external parties. You can also write your own functions!\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you are writing a function, you need to think of the following things:\n",
    "* What is the purpose of the function?\n",
    "* How should I name the function?\n",

    "* What output should the function generate?\n",

    "* encapsulation: wrapping a piece of useful code into a function so that it can be used without knowledge of the specifics\n",
    "* generalization: making a piece of code useful in varied circumstances through parameters\n",
    "* manageability: Dividing a complex program up into easy-to-manage chunks\n",
    "* maintainability: using meaningful names to make the program better readable and understandable\n",
