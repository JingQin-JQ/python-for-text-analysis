    "Most of the functionality we have used thus far, is simply built into the Python language itself. Now we have also learnt how to write your own functions. Often however you need to use external modules in your code. A lot of external modules are already available in the Python Standard Library, for a wide variety of tasks. There are also countless third-party providers of Python modules.\n",
