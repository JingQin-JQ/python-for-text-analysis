# Chapters

This folder contains all the notebooks that we will use as our course material. For this course, we have divided the chapters into four blocks, each of which are closed off with an assignment:

- **`Block I`:** In this block, we will start with the very basics: you will learn about the simple but very useful built-in function `print()` and how to assign variable names to values. You will also learn what data types are, and we will start working with the numerical ones (integers and floats) and with strings. Finally, we will discuss boolean expressions and conditions (`if`-statements), where we will also introduce you to indentation and nesting.

  - [Chapter 1 - Getting Started with Variables and Values](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Variables%20and%20Values.ipynb) 
  - [Chapter 2 - Basic Data Types (Integers and Floats)](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%202%20-%20Basic%20Data%20Types%20(Integers%20and%20Floats).ipynb) 
  - [Chapter 3 - Strings](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%203%20-%20Strings.ipynb)   
  - [Chapter 4 - Boolean Expressions and Conditions](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%204%20-%20Boolean%20Expressions%20and%20Conditions.ipynb) 
  - [ASSIGNMENT 1](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Assignments/ASSIGNMENT-1.ipynb)

- **`Block II`:** In this block, we will introduce the most important containers in the Python language: **lists**, **sets**, **tuples**, and **dictionaries**. You will learn key concepts that they all share, which are positional arguments, keyword arguments, and mutability. In addition you will learn how to understand and use the methods for each container and how to use built-in functions to analyze/inspect the containers. Finally, you will learn how to loop through all the containers.

  - [Chapter 5 - Containers' core concepts.ipynb](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%205%20-%20Containers'%20core%20concepts.ipynb)
  - [Chapter 6 - Lists.ipynb](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%206%20-%20Lists.ipynb)
  - [Chapter 7 - Sets.ipynb](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%207%20-%20Sets.ipynb)
  - [Chapter 8 - Comparison of lists and sets.ipynb](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%208%20-%20Comparison%20of%20lists%20and%20sets.ipynb)
  - [Chapter 9 - Looping over containers.ipynb](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%209%20-%20Looping%20over%20containers.ipynb)
  - [Chapter 10 - Dictionaries.ipynb](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2010%20-%20Dictionaries.ipynb)
  - [ASSIGNMENT 2](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Assignments/ASSIGNMENT-2.ipynb)
  
- **`Block III`:** In this block for the first time we will interract with the environment outside of our Notebooks, by reading/writing files and by importing some of the most common external libraries (os, datetime, random, requests). We will get familiar with two commonly used file formats: JSON and tabular structures in CSV/TSV. We will also learn how to write our own functions. Finally, we will put our skills together and do some text processing with the Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) library.
