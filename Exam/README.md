# Exam

In week 8 of this course, we will have an exam that tests your knowledge of the Python programming language. For the BA students, this is the final exam that will enable you to show what you have learnt and that you are familiar with the basics of programming. For the MA students, it is primarily meant as a check to assure that your knowledge of the language is sufficient to tackle the final assignment.

We prepared a **[Dummy exam](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/master/Exam/Dummy_Exam_201718.ipynb)** that is representative for the material we covered in this course during the fall of 2017.

#### Last years' exams

This folder contains sample exams from previous years. Note that these **may not be completely representative for the exam you will have** because the course material has slightly changed over the years. But we will discuss everything you need to know for the exam in class, and we will provide you with a representative dummy exam so that you know exactly what will be expected from you.

At the moment there are two sample exams (and one dummy exam). As the course develops over the year, this collection will grow.

Note that this concerns an exam **on paper**. This may seem somewhat unnatural and scary, since you normally don't use pen and paper for programming. However, we want to emphasize that we are not asking you to write complete programs; the exam will only test basic knowledge, most of which will be acquired automatically as long as you keep up with the course material and weekly assignments.
