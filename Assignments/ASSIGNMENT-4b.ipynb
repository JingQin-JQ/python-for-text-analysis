    "# Assignment 4b: Linguistic statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "### This assignment is due 5-12-2017, before 20:00 PM. \n",
    "   \n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to compute statistics on the basis of a corpus, in order to compare it with other corpora. This is useful, because current natural language processing technology is quite sensitive to these differences. A NLP system that is trained on one kind of corpus, and displays very good performance, might perfom much worse on a different kind of corpus. This is known as the problem of *domain adaptation*. "

For example, it would be reasonable not to use two separate helper functions in order to computer **num_tokens** and **num_sents** since they both require you to loop over the **wf elements**."
